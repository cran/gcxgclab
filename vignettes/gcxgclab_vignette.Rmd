The goal of gcxgclab is to provide a comprehensive program for preprocessing and analysis of two dimensional gas chromatography data. It is equipped with functions for baseline correction, smoothing, peak identification, peak alignment, identification of EICs, Mass Spectra, targeted analysis, compound identification with NIST and non-targeted analysis, plus plotting and data visualization. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of gcxgclab from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("gcxgclab")
```

## Citation

If using gcxgclab in your work, please cite us.

Gamble, Stephanie & Granger, Caroline & Mannion, Joseph. gcxgclab: An R-package for two dimensional gas chromatography preprocessing and analysis. *in preparation*. 2024.

## Example

Provided here is an example of the work flow to fully process and analyze an example GCxGC sample.  
  
First, load the package.

``` r
library(gcxgclab)
```

Load the first file. This should be a cdf file containing the processed GCxGC sample data.  
  
Extract data from the file and create data frames for the total ion chromatogram (TIC) data and full mass and intensity data.

``` r
filename <- system.file('extdata','Sample1.cdf',package='gcxgclab')
rt_frame <- extract_data(filename)
```

To visualize the data, graph a contour map of original, raw TIC data. The title may be changed to any string. The daata can be plotted in either 1 of 2 time dimensions. 2 is shown.

``` r
plot_chr(rt_frame, title='Raw Data', scale='linear', dim=2)
```

<img src="../man/figures/raw.png" width="50%" />

For the scale of this data, it is useful to visualize with a contour plot in log base 10 of the TIC data. This is done by changing the scale input from linear to log (log is the default). 

``` r
plot_chr(rt_frame, title='Log Intensity', scale="log")
```

<img src="../man/figures/log.png" width="50%" />

If desired, the phase may be shifted up or down. Shifting the phase in the negative direction (down) by 2 seconds.

``` r
shifted <- phase_shift(rt_frame, shift=-2)
plot_chr(shifted, title='Shifted')
```
<img src="../man/figures/shifted.png" width="50%" />


Performing Whittaker smoothing. Lambda=20 has been chosen for the smoothing coefficient (which is also the default value). Larger values of lambda indicate more smoothing. Lambda must be chosen between 0 and 1000. Plotting in log scale.

``` r
sm_frame <- smooth(rt_frame, lambda=20)
plot_chr(sm_frame, title = 'Smoothed')
```

<img src="../man/figures/smoothed.png" width="50%" />

Performing baseline correction. Gamma = 0.5 (which is also the default value), indicating a moderate amount of noise to be considered baseline. Gamma must be chosen between 0 and 1. 0 results in almost no data being subtracted to the baseline, and 1 results in a high amount of the data being subtracted to the baseline. Plotting in log scale.

``` r
frame <- bl_corr(sm_frame, gamma=0.5)
plot_chr(frame, title = 'Baseline Corrected')
```

<img src="../man/figures/blc.png" width="50%" />

It is helpful to identify peaks in the samples. There are two functions to locate the peaks. One finds the top N peaks, and the second finds all peaks above a given threshold.  
  
Finding the top 20 peaks in the sample. Then finding all peaks above an intensity of 100,000.
``` r
peaks <- top_peaks(frame$TIC_df, N=20)
thrpeaks <- thr_peaks(frame$TIC_df, THR=100000)
```

Now to visualize these peaks. Ploting red circles over the highest 20 peaks on the chromatogram image.

``` r
plot_peak(peaks, frame, title="Top 20 Peaks")
```

<img src="../man/figures/top20a.png" width="50%" />

Plot circles at the highest 20 peaks, size indicating the intensity.

``` r
plot_peakonly(peaks, title="Top 20 Peaks")
```

<img src="../man/figures/top20b.png" width="50%" />

Ploting red circles over all peaks above 100,000 threshold on the chromatogram image.

``` r
plot_peak(thrpeaks, frame, title="Peaks Above 100,000")
```

<img src="../man/figures/thra.png" width="50%" />

Plot circles at all peaks above 10,000 threshold, size indicating the intensity.

``` r
plot_peakonly(thrpeaks, title="Peaks Above 100,000")
```

<img src="../man/figures/thrb.png" width="50%" />

Loading a second cdf file and performing smoothing and baseline correction for alignment to the first sample.

``` r
filename2 <- system.file('extdata','Sample2.cdf',package='gcxgclab')
rt_frame2 <- extract_data(filename2)
sm_frame2 <- smooth(rt_frame2, lambda=20)
frame2 <- bl_corr(sm_frame2, gamma=0.5)

peaks2 <- top_peaks(frame2$TIC_df, N=20)
plot_peak(peaks2, frame, title="Top 20 Peaks, Sample 2")
```

<img src="../man/figures/top20_2.png" width="50%" />

Loading a third cdf file and performing smoothing and baseline correction for alignment to the first sample.

``` r
filename3 <- system.file('extdata','Sample3.cdf',package='gcxgclab')
rt_frame3 <- extract_data(filename3)
sm_frame3 <- smooth(rt_frame3, lambda=20)
frame3 <- bl_corr(sm_frame3, gamma=0.5)

peaks3 <- top_peaks(frame3$TIC_df, N=20)
plot_peak(peaks3, frame, title="Top 20 Peaks, Sample 3")
```

<img src="../man/figures/top20_3.png" width="50%" />

Performing batch alignment to a reference sample. "Sample 1" is given as the reference sample. 
This keeps all peaks from reference sample, then aligns corresponding peaks from each of the other samples, returns a list of data frames for each, keeping peak height unchanged, only coordinate shifted to align with reference peak.

``` r
aligned_list <- align(list(frame,frame2,frame3))
for (i in 1:3){
    print(plot_peak(aligned_list$peaks[[i]], aligned_list$data[[i]], title=paste("Aligned Sample", i)))
  }
```

In the analysis of this data, there are many times where fitting to a Gaussian curve is used. Fitting the highest peak in the sample to a 1D Gaussian curve. The area under the curve is calculated. Plot of points in blue and fitted curve in red.

``` r
peak_t <- c(peaks$'X'[1], peaks$'Y'[1])
gaussfit <- gauss_fit(frame$TIC_df, peakcoord=peak_t)
```

    #> Area under curve = 2208363.21987165 u^2

``` r
plot_gauss(frame$TIC_df, gaussfit[[1]])
```

<img src="../man/figures/gauss1.png" width="50%" />

Fitting the highest peak in the sample to a 2D Gaussian curve. The volume under the curve is calculated. Contour plot of the fitted curve.

``` r
gaussfit2 <- gauss2_fit(frame$TIC_df, peakcoord=peak_t)
```

    #> Volume under curve = 16457652.920234 u^3

``` r
plot_gauss2(frame$TIC_df, gaussfit2[[1]])
```

<img src="../man/figures/gauss2.png" width="50%" />

Finding extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) for the specific masses of interest 141.9274 u. EIC visualization can be done in 1 or 2 dimensions.

``` r
eic <- find_eic(frame, MOI=141.9274)
plot_eic(eic,dim=1)
plot_eic(eic,dim=2)
```

<img src="../man/figures/eica.png" width="50%" />

Identifying the compound of the highest TIC peak with the NIST MS database.   
  
Note, this only works if the user has a NIST MS Library license already purchased. First the NIST Library is loaded, which in this case is in seven different MSP files. Then comparing the MS data to the loaded NIST Library.

``` r
nistlist <-nist_list('NIST17_01.MSP','NIST17_02.MSP','NIST17_03.MSP','NIST17_04.MSP','NIST17_05.MSP','NIST17_06.MSP','NIST17_07.MSP')
comp_nist(nistlist, mz)
```

Performing non-targeted analysis, identifying compound with the exact mass data. The minimum threshold for peaks is set to 0.05 (which is default).

``` r
masslist <- mass_list()
non_targeted(masslist, mz, THR=0.05)
```

    #> The best mass solution found is C7H8.

Performing targeted analysis to identify peak areas for MOIs at given retention times. MOIs = c(141.9274, 92.1397, 92.1397, 78.113) at corresponding retention times RTs = c(3.8273333, 9.111583, 13.782750, 18.5691167). The list of data and the list of MOIs are required inputs. The RTs are not required. If left blank, the program will identify the highest point and use that retention time. There are several other optional inputs. Window size (window_size input variable) may also be given, specified for each MOI/RT pair. A tolerance (tolerance input variable) may be given to specify a tolerance around the MOIs that is to be allowed. Default is 0.005. Lastly, a string may be input (images input variable) for the name of a pdf file where images will be saved. If left blank, plots will be printed, two for each MOI/RT pair: a plot of the entire EIC showing the peak of interest, and a zoomed in plot at the RT of interest.

``` r
targeted(list(frame,frame2,frame3), MOIs = c(141.9274, 92.1397, 92.1397, 78.113), RTs = c(3.8273333, 9.111583, 13.782750, 18.5691167),images=TRUE)
```
	#> MOI        |   141.9274    92.1397    92.1397     78.113
	#> RT         |  3.8273333   9.111583   13.78275 18.5691167
